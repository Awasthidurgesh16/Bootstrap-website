          <h4><B>What’s Good :</B></h4> Karan Johar is back with a heart warming tale of love and its complicated nature. The relationship drama looks magnificent, has great actors and amazing music. What more do you want?

<h4><B>What’s Bad :</B></h4>The characters are not card board cut outs from your drawing room so relativity on some levels. A few Bollywood cliches that are always significant to Karan Johar films.

<h4><B>Loo Break:</B></h4> None for me!

<h4><B>Watch or Not?:</B></h4>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is for lovers. Everyone who believes in the power of it and has been through a heartbreak or even close to it, will like this film.

<h4>User Rating:</h4> 4/5
</p>

<h3>Script Analysis</h3>
<p>Love ‘tedha hota hai’ is the truest statements you will learn from Karan Johar’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Of course it is also true that the one who falls for this concept will say ‘tedha hai par mera hai’. This is exactly what ADHM is all about. It deals with the complexities and blurred lines between love and friendship and the fact that the former cannot be manufactured.

One strength of Ae Dil is the amazing dialogues. Yes! There are a lot of philosophies being thrown at you but you may very well connect with them.

I mean come on, who has expressed happiness in a better dialogue than ‘Dil ka pet bhar gaya ho’.

There’s also a noteworthy dialogue of Alizeh explaining why she hates flowers and it is quite aptly said.

In terms of characters, Ayan and Alizeh are fine but Sabah’s character lacks depth. There could have been more to that angle.

Karan gets most of his script right up until the end when he messes it up with a huge cliche.</p>
</p>
<h3>Star Performance</h3>
<p>Ranbir Kapoor has nailed the ‘friendzoned’, heart broken lover act. Yes, it is like Rockstar but then again, that was his great act too. As Ayan he is lovable and you want to pull his cheeks too just like Anushka.

Anushka Sharma looks beautiful as Alizeh. She is a delight as the bubbly girl who breaks down when in pain. After Sultan, another good act from her.

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan looks like a dream. She can truly give all the new gen actresses a run for their money when it comes to being sexy with grace.

Lisa Haydon’s cameo as Ayan’s girlfriend is totally spot on. She is funny as heck.

Fawad Khan is hot! You can’t take your eyes off Ali.

Shah Rukh Khan too gets a small role and he cracks the most important dialogue of the film, “Ek tarfa pyaar ki takaat kuch aur hoti hai, wo auron ki tarah do logon mein nahi batti. Sirf mera haq hai iss par.”

Alia Bhatt and Imran Abbas are seen in glamorous cameos.</p>

<h3>The Last Words</h3>
<p>Ae Dil Hai Mushkil is all about accepting ‘I Friend You’ over ‘I Love You’. Trust me getting friend zoned never looked so good. I am going with a 3/5 for the film.</p>
